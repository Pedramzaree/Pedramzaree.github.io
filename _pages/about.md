About me
======
Greetings! I am a passionate Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of California, Riverside, where I delve into the dynamic realms of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) systems, and Security. My academic journey is driven by a relentless curiosity to explore the intersection of these cutting-edge fields, unravelling the complexities and pushing the boundaries of technology. As an aspiring researcher, I am committed to advancing knowledge and contributing to the evolution of innovative solutions in the ever-evolving landscape of computer science. Join me on this intellectual adventure as I navigate the frontiers of technology, seeking to make meaningful contributions to the world of academia and beyond.

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

(https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
